<h1>Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML</h1>

<p>This project was completed as part of the Data Science and Business Analytics internship program offered by The Sparks Foundation. The goal of the project was to predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied. This was done using supervised machine learning techniques.</p>

<h2>Project Details</h2>

<p>The project was completed in the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data was imported and preprocessed as needed.</li>
  <li>The data was then split into training and testing sets.</li>
  <li>A linear regression model was trained on the training set.</li>
  <li>The model was then used to make predictions on the testing set.</li>
  <li>The accuracy of the model was evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error metric.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>The following libraries are required to run the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
  <li>NumPy</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  <li>Scikit-learn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Files</h2>

<p>The following files are included in the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Task 1 - Prediction using Supervised ML.ipynb</code>: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project.</li>
